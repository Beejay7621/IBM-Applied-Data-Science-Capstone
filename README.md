This project involves predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.  This is as a result of a fictional startup that is intending to compete with SpaceX.  I follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting.
